* nvIPFIX

  nvIPFIX (nvipfix) is an IPFIX exporter written as open source application in C, based on fixbuf library (<https://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf/index.html>), released for Unix operating systems under GNU General Public License. See "Licensing" section for details.
  nvIPFIX exports TCP/IP connection flow statistics from a Netvisor or Open Netvisor Linux (ONVL) switch to an IPFIX Collector using standard IPFIX bi-flow format, as defined in the following RFC: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5103>.
  The exporter is typically compiled and runs inside the switch operating system, where periodically retrieves connection statistics thru Netvisor C-API functions, which then exports in IPFIX format to a configured set of collectors, using various transport methods: UDP, TCP/IP, SCTP. The export interval period is configurable and defaults to one minute.
  Optionally the exporter can be compiled and run on an external Unix server. In such case, other than the set of collectors and export interval, the exporter needs to be configured with the switch host information and Netvisor user credentials.

* Installation and Building

  Supported OS:
    - Linux
    - Solaris

  Prerequisites:
    - fixbuf library (https://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf/index.html)
    - log4c library (http://log4c.sourceforge.net/)
    - OpenSSL library (https://www.openssl.org/)
    - GLib 2 (https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/)
    
  Tools:
    - GCC 4
    - GNU make
    - pkg-config

  Run 'make all' ('gmake -f solaris.mak all' on Solaris) command to build. Binary can be found in a 'bin' directory.
  
  
* Configuration

  Configuration is stored in file 'nvipfix.config' in local directory
  Sample configuration (running from Netvisor/ONVL switch):
  -----
  #### Export Interval
  # defines the polling frequency for connection statistics
  #
  #
  export-interval 00:01:00	# hh:mm:ss
  #
  ####


  #### List of collectors
  collector collectorName {
	  collector-hostname 192.168.0.6
	  transport udp
	  transport-port 9991
	  dscp 0
  }
  ####
  -----
  
  
* Usage

  As daemon:
    nvIPFIX start|stop
  As single batch execution (configured export-interval setting is ignored):
    nvIPFIX [-fdatafile] <start_ts> <end_ts>"
      datafile - offline data file in JSON format (for debug purpose)
      start_ts/end_ts - ISO 8601 datetime (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SS)
